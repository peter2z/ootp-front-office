 * Why this season's committed total is not the payroll figure beside it.

 * They are different numbers and the difference is not noise. A club's own
 * payroll in OOTP, set against the contracts listed here, leaves out two things:
 *
 *  - Money still owed to players who have left, which the game keeps outside
 *    its payroll figure. Twenty-two clubs across three saves had some. With it
 *    taken out, the gap to the contract sum on every one of them comes in whole
 *    multiples of the minor-league difference below; with it left in, on none.
 *  - Players in the minors on a major-league MINIMUM contract, whom it charges
 *    at the minor-league wage and not at the salary on the deal: $132,000
 *    against $800,000 in a 2028 league, $84,150 against $510,000 in a 2015 one
 *    and $135,300 against $820,000 in a 2029 one, which is 16.5 per cent of the
 *    minimum every time. The Dodgers have ten of them, so $668,000 each comes
 *    to $6,680,000 off — to the dollar the amount the page had no name for.
 *    Across those saves 59 of 92 clubs come out exactly on it, and 90 to a
 *    whole number of such players.
 *
 * A share of a salary that somebody else is paying is not a term. It is already
 * out of the committed total (see payingShare), so there is nothing to bridge.
 *
 * The remainder is attributed to the minimum-salary players only where they can
 * account for it. The wage is inferred, not published, so it is not hard-coded
 * here: a league that charges them differently leaves a different remainder and
 * the line still adds up. It is called "other" when they cannot be the cause —
 * nobody to blame, or a remainder larger than they cost.
 *
 * Null when OOTP gave no payroll figure, because there is then nothing to start
 * the line from.
