 * trading block into `players_roster_status.trade_status`, and the assistants
 * were reasoning about the whole league as though every player were equally
 * gettable. They were not — in the save this was built against, 153 men were
 * listed and the four best clubs had listed nobody at all, while the worst had
 * between four and ten each. Knowing which is the difference between "ask
 * anyway, sometimes people answer" and "he is already on the market".
 *
 * The meaning of the flag is read off the data rather than assumed: clubs
 * listing players are the ones out of the race, and the ones listed are aging
 * regulars on expiring money. That is a selling list, and nothing else fits.
