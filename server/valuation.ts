 * the export says which, so the app reads the top of the scale off the data
 * (ratingScaleMax, above). Every threshold the server applies to a rating — a
 * ceiling of 55, a gap of 15, an average glove of 50 — was chosen on 20-80 and
 * meant nothing anywhere else: on the 1-to-5 scale a 55 can never be reached
 * and a gap of 15 can never be seen, so the advice did not fail loudly, it
 * came out quietly wrong.
 *
 * A cut-off is therefore written once, as the 20-80 number it always was, and
 * passed through here. The conversion is proportional, which is how the bars
 * already draw a grade — the same share of the top of the scale whichever scale
 * shows it — so it serves for a gap as well as for a level: 15 is 15 on 20-80
 * and a little under 1 on 1-5. On 20-80 itself it returns what it was given,
 * which is what keeps every existing save exactly as it was.
 *
 * It is a plain number and not a whole grade. A 1-to-5 save has no 3.4375, but
 * a rating set against one is simply above it or not, and rounding the cut-off
 * first would move it by up to half a grade.
 *
 * Proportional is exact for 20-80 and 2-8, which are one scale at a tenth the
 * size, and close on 1-5. On 1-10 and 1-20, which start at one rather than a
 * quarter of the way up, it runs high for a level — an average 50 comes out at
 * 6.25 and 12.5 where the middle of the scale is 5.5 and 10.5 — and low for a
 * gap. That is within what these cut-offs can bear, and this is the one place
 * to refine if it ever is not.
 *
 * ratingScaleMax reads a 1-100 save as 20-80 on purpose (see the note there), so
 * there this is the identity, which is what every threshold did before the
