 * transactions section, and for the reason that makes it more than a diary:
 * "so we can watch similar moves we might want to jump on — a player who fits
 * our needs gets waived, released, etc."
 *
 * OOTP exports this and no screen here was reading it. `trade_history` carries
 * every deal in the universe with a written summary, both clubs and every
 * player in it; `messages` carries the signings and the waiver claims, which
 * are not trades and appear nowhere else.
 *
 * Nothing is inferred. Earlier versions of features in this app have tried to
 * work out what happened by comparing one import against the next, and a
 * player who simply changed level looks identical to one who was sold. These
 * are the game's own records of its own transactions.
