/**
 * Buy, hold or sell — and the arithmetic behind it.
 *
 * The question a deadline actually poses is not "are we good" but "can we
 * still get there from here", and those come apart badly. A club five games
 * out in May and a club five games out in September are the same line in the
 * standings and opposite answers.
 *
 * So the verdict is driven by one number: the chance of reaching the
 * postseason, worked out rather than felt. Talent comes from run differential
 * instead of won-lost record, because a club's runs predict its future better
 * than its results do — a 45-46 team outscoring its opponents by fifty is a
 * good team having bad luck, and it should be buying.
 *
 * Deliberately willing to say hold. Most clubs most of the time genuinely are
 * on the fence, and a tool that manufactures a decision to seem useful is
 * worse than one that admits the season has not decided yet.
