 * of them are the same grade of filler, so the total tracked headcount: on a
 * real save the Spearman correlation between farm rank and players in the
 * system was 0.973, the top ten farms held 288 to 310 players, and the Dodgers,
 * with 248, ranked 24th. Fifty more replacement-level players would have lifted
 * any system's rank, which is the opposite of what the rank is for.
 *
 * Ten, because that is what "how strong is this farm" is conventionally asked
 * of: the prospects who will actually matter, with nothing beneath them able to
 * move the answer. On the same save the correlation with headcount falls to
 * about zero. They are ranked on OOTP's talent value, a ceiling that has no
 * scale to assume, rather than by counting 50-grade players — which would tie
 * most systems on a handful of whole numbers and means nothing on a save whose
 * ratings are not 20-80.
