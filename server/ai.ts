      `shortstop are not the same asset.\n` +
      `- Use "seasonLines": one line for each level he played at this season, the highest first, ` +
      `each labelled with its level and club. Each is read against that level's league and in the ` +
      `park he played most of it in, so OPS+, wRC+ and ERA+ (100 is average) compare across levels ` +
      `and parks; the raw rates do not. Never add one level's line to another's, and say when a ` +
      `sample is too small to mean anything.\n` +
    `- ${VALUE_PERCENTILE_NOTE}\n` +
    `- "onTheBlock" names the men in this deal whose own club has listed them for trade. A club ` +
    `that has listed a player wants to move him and the price starts lower; a club that has not ` +
    `is being asked for a favour and will charge for it. Say which of these you are dealing with.\n` +
    `- Judge the glove as well as the bat. "fielding" gives his rating at each position he can ` +
    `play, on ${ratingScaleBrief()}, with his ceiling where he has one — "${onThisScale(60)} at ` +
    `2B, ${onThisScale(35)} at SS (ceiling ${onThisScale(55, Math.floor)})" means he is a good ` +
    `second baseman who is not a shortstop yet and may never ` +
    `be. "fieldingStats" is what he has actually done out there, this season and last: games, ` +
    `errors, fielding percentage and zone rating. Say what a move down the defensive spectrum ` +
    `costs, and never claim a man can play a position his ratings do not support. Only the ` +
    `positions the game has actually rated him at appear — a position missing from the list is ` +
    `one nobody has graded yet, not one he is known to be incapable of, so treat it as unknown ` +
    `and say so if it matters.\n` +
      `- Name who the incoming player would displace. "whoTheyWouldDisplace" lists the men already ` +
      `holding that job on the major-league roster, with their own lines. If he is not better than ` +
      `the man in the job, say so — an upgrade that does not upgrade anything is not one. If he is ` +
      `not major-league ready, say where he actually slots and when he might matter.\n` +
      `- Weigh it against what the club is short of. "clubNeeds" gives the weakest positions and ` +
      `the spare ones, the rotation (SP) and the bullpen (RP) among them: value bought where you ` +
      `are already deep is worth less than the number says.\n` +
      `- Then the ordinary things: age, contract years, salary, and what the money commits you to.\n` +
    `- A line covers every club he played for at that level, named in "club". Where he changed ` +
    `hands mid-season, "byClub" splits it, each club's part read in its own park: say what he ` +
    `has done since the move as well as across the year — a hot six weeks in a new park is a ` +
    `different fact from a full season, and the reader wants both.\n` +
    `- A contract ending is not a player leaving. Each man carries a "control" field: "leaving" ` +
    `reaches free agency, "arbitration" means he is kept and paid more, "pre-arbitration" kept ` +
    `cheaply, "reserve clause" cannot leave. Never call somebody a rental or a walk-year player ` +
    `from years-remaining alone — arbitration years are years of control, and they are worth ` +
    `paying for.\n` +
      `- "totals" holds the figures shown on the page beside your answer. The summed value and ` +
    `talent reward bodies, so they are not the verdict. "surplusSent" and "surplusReceived" are ` +
    `what each side is worth over replacement, the 25th percentile of major leaguers in each ` +
    `man's own group (position players, starters, relievers), so a throw-in adds nothing. ` +
    `"bestPctSent" and "bestPctReceived" are the best man on each side, as a percentile of his ` +
    `group. "verdict" says which side gives up more surplus. "quantityForQuality" is true when ` +
    `that side does it with several men and none of them is within 15 percentile points of the ` +
    `best man coming the other way: more bodies for one better player, which the surplus figure ` +
    `flatters, because roster places are not free. Quote these if you quote totals at all, so ` +
    `the two never disagree — but a verdict that is only those totals restated is not worth ` +
