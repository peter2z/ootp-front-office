/**
 * What a man can actually play, and how well.
 *
 * OOTP rates every player at all nine positions, now and projected, and keeps
 * the components underneath — range, arm, hands, the double play, and the
 * three that only matter behind the plate. None of it was reaching the app.
 * The trade desk was judging deals on bats alone and said so when pressed:
 * asked whether a second baseman could be moved to shortstop, it answered that
 * it had no fielding ratings in front of it and would not guess. It was right
 * not to guess, and wrong to have been asked without them.
 *
 * Only what OOTP has already shown you. A current rating above zero is the
 * game's own flag for a position it has revealed: it prints the number there
 * and a dash everywhere else, and the app must not print what the dash is
 * hiding.
 *
 * Checked against the game rather than assumed. Trent Grisham's card in OOTP
 * shows 60 in center field and a dash at all eight others; his row here holds
 * a 75 ceiling in left, a 65 in right and a 70 as a pitcher, none of it
 * revealed. Right field is the one that settles the rule — two hundred
 * experience there and OOTP still prints a dash — so having played a position
 * does not expose it either. The current rating is the only signal that does.
 *
 * The cost of the alternative is worth stating: showing a ceiling the game has
 * withheld would hand you a scouting report you have not earned, in an app
 * whose whole purpose is to read your save rather than to play it for you.
