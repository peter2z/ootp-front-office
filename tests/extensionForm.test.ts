/**
 * An extension has to be backed by the season, not by the Value figure alone.
 *
 * A user wrote in about two long relievers with earned run averages of 6.51
 * and 9.45 who were being reported at the 93rd and 95th percentile of
 * major-league value, one of them with the advice: "performing at a
 * 93rd-percentile MLB value ... we must initiate extension talks immediately".
 *
 * Both halves of that were wrong. OOTP's Value is value TO THE CLUB and counts
 * playing time — across the 280 major-league relievers in the save this was
 * checked against, Value tracked innings at +0.37 and ERA at +0.19, the wrong
 * way round, while tracking the stuff rating at +0.12 — so a converted starter
 * soaking up long relief rises to the top of the reliever pool whatever he
 * does with the ball. And no statistics were sent with the percentile, so
 * nothing the assistant had could contradict the word "performing".
 *
 * The veto that came of it is not the same size for everybody: a poor line is
 * readable at 100 plate appearances but says little about a 24-year-old whose
 * talent is at the 97th percentile, so the sample it takes to overrule the value
 * figure grows with youth and talent. That rule has its own tests in
 * contractAdvice.test.ts; the cases here are the ones where it must not let the
 * original report back in.
