/**
 * The pitcher the lineup card is built against.
 *
 * "I can see you've flagged who the likely next pitcher they will face is. If
 * possible it would be good to be able to set a line up or at least see your
 * best lineup against that pitcher."
 *
 * It already does, and had for a long time: the page reads tonight's probable
 * starter and defaults the platoon side to his hand. What it never did was say
 * so — the confirmation only appeared as a button, and only once the reader had
 * wandered off the default. So the feature he asked for was the one he was
 * already looking at, silently.
 *
 * I also went looking for a bug here that is not one. `projected_starting_
 * pitchers` is the rotation as it stands on the export's own date, so slot zero
 * is whoever pitches next; the schedule's Plan panel counts along that array
 * only because it is asked about games days out. For our own next unplayed
 * game there is nothing to count. (The opponent's slot is a different matter:
 * he is counted along his own club's remaining games, which is what
 * server/schedule.ts's probableStarters does and tests/probableStarterSchedule
 * covers.) These pin that down so the next person to think it is wrong can
 * find out cheaply.
