/**
 * Every page that prints a grade must print it the way the setting asks.
 *
 * The increments-of-five toggle worked on the player card and the hover card
 * and nowhere else: the depth chart, the farm system and the draft board all
 * rendered the raw number, so turning it on changed one screen out of four and
 * looked broken rather than partial. A setting is only as honest as the last
 * page that remembered it, and remembering is not something to leave to
 * whoever writes the next table.
 *
 * So this walks the source instead. Any file interpolating a grade has to pull
 * in the formatter — which is not proof it used it on that line, but it does
 * catch the case that actually happened: a new table written without the
 * setting in mind at all.
