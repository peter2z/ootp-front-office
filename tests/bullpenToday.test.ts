/**
 * What day it is, on a page headed "availability tonight".
 *
 * A reader: "Bullpen Availability Tonight is off by one day for every pitcher.
 * Where it says today, it should say yesterday; yesterday -> 2 days ago; 2d ->
 * 3d. Availability itself and number of pitches thrown is correct."
 *
 * He had it exactly. The page asked the games table for the newest date it
 * held and called that today — but he exports after simming, so the newest
 * games in the file are the ones just played and the league has already moved
 * on to the next morning. Every label was a day stale while the arithmetic
 * under them, done in whole days from the same rows, was right.
 *
 * Tonight's game is by definition the one that has not been played. Asking the
 * games table when now is could only ever answer with the past.
