/**
 * The game plan, on exports that are not shaped like mine.
 *
 * A reader updated, opened the schedule, pressed Plan, and got "500 Internal
 * Server Error" on every game in it. The endpoint asked games.csv for
 * `starter0` and `starter1` — the pitchers a PLAYED game recorded — without
 * checking they were there, and OOTP does not put them in every export. One
 * missing column, and the whole feature was dead for that save.
 *
 * The endpoint had no test at all, which is how a query could name a column
 * nobody had confirmed was universal. These cover the shapes an export can
 * come in rather than only the one on this machine: the fixture's `games`
 * table has no starter columns, so simply asking for a plan is the regression
 * test for the fault that was reported.
