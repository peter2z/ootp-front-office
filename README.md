# OOTP Front Office

A local web app that turns an **Out of the Park Baseball 27** save into a front-office
command center: rosters, prospect promotion signals, contract decisions, trade fits,
development tracking, and AI-written beat coverage of your organization.

Everything runs on your own machine. Nothing is uploaded anywhere (the optional AI
features are the one exception — those send your league data to the Anthropic API).

```
OOTP CSV export  →  importer (SQLite)  →  local server  →  browser UI
```

---

## What it does

Pick your organization in the header and every page shows that club's world — the MLB
team and every affiliate down to the DSL. Switch orgs any time to scout another system.

**The app wears your team's colors.** Selecting a club re-themes the entire interface —
backgrounds, panels, borders, and accent — from that team's actual colors in your save,
and shows its logo. Team logos come from your own OOTP installation
(`<save>.lg/news/html/images/team_logos`), so they work offline and are correct for
custom and fictional leagues that have no logo anywhere on the internet.

Every generated palette is checked against WCAG AA contrast so the interface stays
readable no matter how bright or washed-out a club's colors are — a pure-white primary
(the White Sox) falls back to a neutral slate, and a low-luminance accent gets brightened
until it's legible. Run `npm run check:theme` to verify all 30 clubs.

The navigation is grouped by front-office function:

**🏟 Dashboard** — the morning check-in. Pending-decision chips that click through to
the page that resolves them, division standings, last 5 results, upcoming games with
probable starters, hot/cold hitters, the org injury list, and an AI GM briefing.

**📰 Storylines** — AI-written beat coverage of your organization, grounded in your
actual save data.

**⚾ Clubhouse** — running the big-league club

| Page | What you get |
|------|--------------|
| Lineup | Sabermetric (Tango's *The Book*) or traditional ordering, platoon-aware, auto-built against tonight's probable opposing starter. Positions are chosen on offence adjusted for fielding ability, so the best bat plays the spot he can actually field |
| Rosters | Any team in your org with scout ratings and sortable stat lines. **Pick your own columns** — 24 batting and 23 pitching stats to choose from, including OPS+, wRC+, ERA+, FIP, wOBA, and BABIP |
| Depth Chart | Positions × affiliates grid, each player with age and current→potential |
| Injury Report | Org-wide trainer's report with estimated return dates |
| Coaching Staff | Coaches, scouts, and farm managers with role-relevant ratings |

**🌾 Farm System** — your own pipeline

| Page | What you get |
|------|--------------|
| Prospects | Minor leaguers ranked by promotion signal, self-calibrated to your league's own level averages |
| Development | Scout-rating changes over time — who's improving, who's declining, whose ceiling moved |

**💼 Front Office** — transactions and money

| Page | What you get |
|------|--------------|
| Contracts | Every deal sorted by urgency with re-sign / extend / let-walk recommendations |
| Free Agents | Current market plus everyone hitting free agency after this season |
| Trade Center | Trade analyzer with value/salary swings, AI verdict, plus league-wide fit finder |
| 40-Man Roster | Roster counts, options used, out-of-options, Rule 5 exposure, DFA countdowns |

**✦ Ask** — the chat panel, from any page

Ask questions about your league in plain English: "who should I call up?", "which
contracts should I worry about?", "can Bednar pitch tonight?". The assistant answers by
calling the app's own endpoints — the same ones the pages read — so it can never disagree
with what you see on screen, and it is told plainly that its training data knows nothing
about your simulated league. It shows which lookups it ran while answering.

Requires an Anthropic API key (**Settings → AI Features**); everything else in the app
works without one.

**📊 League** — reference

| Page | What you get |
|------|--------------|
| Standings | Every division with run differential, current streaks, magic number, and the record each club is on pace for |
| Franchise History | Every season the club has played — win curve, finishes, titles, payroll and attendance |
| Org Comparison | Your farm system and major-league talent ranked against the rest of the league |
| Player Search | Search anyone in the league by name; filter by level, org, or free agency |
| Draft Board | The draft class ranked by ceiling, from the day OOTP publishes it |
| Leaderboards | League top-10s with your players highlighted |
| My Watchlist | Star any player and keep your own scouting notes |

Click any player name anywhere for a full dossier: bio, ratings with potential markers,
pitch arsenal and velocity, contract schedule, career history by level, fielding by position
and season, honours (MVPs, Cy Youngs, Gold Gloves, All-Star selections), where he has
finished in a league category, recent game logs, and injury history.

**Export as a website** — **Settings → Share** writes your club's pages out as a plain static
site: a folder you can upload to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any web host so other people can
browse your league. It takes about 20 seconds and comes to a few megabytes, player cards
included. It is a snapshot rather than a live view, and it contains league data only — your
API key and settings are never written into it. The AI features, watchlist, player search and
settings all need a running server, so they are left out of the exported copy.

---

## Install

**Most people want the desktop app.** Grab the installer for your platform from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/lsukev/ootp-front-office/releases) — no Node, no
terminal, no npm. Then skip to [Export your league from OOTP](#3-export-your-league-from-ootp).

- **macOS** — open the `.dmg` and drag the app to Applications
- **Windows** — run the `.exe` installer

> **Windows SmartScreen warning:** the Windows build is not code-signed yet, so Windows
> will say "Windows protected your PC." Click **More info → Run anyway**. (Signing costs
> a few hundred dollars a year; it'll be added if the project gets enough users.)

Everything the app writes — the imported database, your watchlist, AI caches — lives in
your OS user-data folder, not inside the app. **Help → Open Data Folder** takes you there.

### Updates

The desktop app checks GitHub for a new release each time it starts and shows an
**↑ Update** button in the header when one is available. Nothing downloads until you ask
it to, and nothing installs until you restart — the app will not swap itself out from
under you mid-session. **Settings → Updates** has the same controls plus a **Check now**
button and the release notes.

Your imported database, watchlist, and settings live outside the app bundle, so updating
never touches them.

> Updating from **v0.2.0 or earlier requires one manual download**, because those builds
> shipped before auto-update existed. From v0.3.0 onward it is automatic.

On Windows the update runs the same unsigned installer as a fresh download, so
SmartScreen will prompt again until the app is code-signed.

### Running from source alongside the desktop app

They are two separate installs and keep **separate data**. The desktop app writes to
your OS user-data folder; running from source writes to the project's `data/` folder.
Each has its own database, settings, API key, GM briefing, and chat history — so a
briefing you generated in the app will not appear in the from-source copy, and vice
versa.

To make the from-source server use the desktop app's data instead, point it there:

```bash
# macOS
OOTP_FO_DATA_DIR="$HOME/Library/Application Support/ootp-front-office" npm start

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:OOTP_FO_DATA_DIR="$env:APPDATA\ootp-front-office"; npm start
```

Now both see the same league, briefing, conversation, and key.

> **Run one at a time.** Both write the same SQLite database and settings file, and
> re-importing from one while the other is reading it will end badly. Quit the desktop
> app before starting the server this way.

### Reaching it from another computer

The server listens on `127.0.0.1` and answers only to localhost, so by default
nothing else on your network can see it. To open it to your own LAN:

```bash
OOTP_FO_BIND=0.0.0.0 npm start
```

It prints the address to use, e.g. `http://192.168.1.50:5178`. Open that on the
other computer.

> **There is no password.** Anyone who can reach that address can read the whole
> save, change settings, and spend your Anthropic credits through the assistant.
> Use it on a network you trust and never forward the port from your router.

Opening the bind address does not disable the protection against malicious web
pages: the server still answers only to its own names and addresses, which it
reads from the machine's network interfaces. If you reach it by some other name
(a DNS alias, a reverse proxy), add it:

```bash
OOTP_FO_BIND=0.0.0.0 OOTP_FO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=baseball.lan npm start
```

For access from outside your home, don't open a port — tunnel instead:

```bash
ssh -N -L 5178:127.0.0.1:5178 you@your-home-machine
```

Then browse `http://localhost:5178` on the remote computer. Or use
**Settings → Share** to export a static copy and host that anywhere.

The rest of this section is for running from source.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Vitest, against a hand-built fixture league in a temp directory — no save
required, so it runs in CI and gates every release. The fixture exists to pin
down the cases that have actually shipped as bugs: a player optioned to the
affiliate, one traded away with nothing retained, a signed extension that has
not started, a man parked on a club with no roster spot, and a player sitting
on the free-agency service boundary.

Two more checks need a real import and so are run by hand:

```bash
npm run check:stats    # OPS+, wRC+, ERA+ and FIP centre on 100 in every league
npm run check:theme    # all 30 clubs pass WCAG AA in both modes
```

---

## Requirements

- **OOTP Baseball 27** with at least one save
- **Node.js 20 or newer** — check with `node --version`
  ([download](https://nodejs.org) if you don't have it; the LTS build is fine)
- macOS or Windows
- *(Optional)* An [Anthropic API key](https://console.claude.com) for the AI features

---

## Installation

### 1. Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lsukev/ootp-front-office.git
cd ootp-front-office
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This takes a minute or two. It compiles a native SQLite module, so if it fails, see
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### 3. Export your league from OOTP

**This is the step people miss.** The app never touches OOTP's binary save files — it
reads the game's own CSV database export, which you generate from inside OOTP:

1. Launch OOTP 27 and load your save
2. Open the **Database Tools** menu (top of the screen)
3. Choose **Global Actions → Export data to CSV files**
4. Let it finish — it writes ~70 files and takes 10-30 seconds

The export lands inside your save folder at `<your save>.lg/import_export/csv/`. You
don't need to remember that path; the app finds it automatically.

The field delimiter does not matter — OOTP's **Export Field Delimiter** setting can be a
comma, a semicolon, a tab or a pipe, and the importer works out which one each file uses.

### 4. Start the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

The app scans the standard OOTP 27 save locations and lists what it finds. Click your
save and it imports everything (a full league is ~2.5 million rows and takes about 40
seconds). Saves without a CSV export are shown greyed out.

To stop the app, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

---

## Daily workflow

1. Sim in OOTP as usual
2. When you want fresh data: **Database Tools → Global Actions → Export data to CSV files**
3. The app notices the new export within about ten seconds and offers to reload it — click
   **Refresh now** in the banner

The header shows the league date, which is where the game itself has got to, and when the
data was last exported. The **↻ Refresh** button re-imports on demand, and **Settings →
Watch for new exports** turns the banner off.

Each import also snapshots every player's scout ratings into a separate database that
survives re-imports — that's what powers the **Development** page. The more often you
export, the richer your development history gets.

---

## Optional: enable the AI features

Five features call out to an AI service: **The Paper**, the **Daily Recap**, the **GM
Briefing** on the dashboard, **AI trade verdicts** in the Trade Center, and the **staff
chat** (Ask). Everything else works without a key.

Four services are supported, and Settings lets you pick one:

| Service | Key from | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic (Claude)** | [console.claude.com](https://console.claude.com) | What the app was built against. The staff chat uses tool calling with prompt caching, which is Anthropic's shape |
| **OpenAI** | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) | |
| **Google Gemini** | [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com) | |
| **OpenCode Zen** | [opencode.ai/auth](https://opencode.ai/auth) | A gateway rather than a laboratory: one key reaching Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi and the rest — several of them free |

1. Get a key from whichever you prefer (on the paid ones you'll need a little credit —
   each generation costs a few cents)
2. Open **⚙ Settings** in the app, choose the service, paste the key, and hit
   **Verify and save**

The key is checked against the API before it's stored, so a typo is caught immediately.
In the desktop app it's encrypted against your OS keychain (Keychain on macOS, DPAPI on
Windows); running from source without a keychain available, it falls back to a
permission-restricted file and Settings tells you so.

An environment variable (or a `.env` file) still works and takes priority, so existing
setups are unchanged — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` or
`OPENCODE_API_KEY`, whichever matches the service you've chosen. If no key is present,
the AI buttons explain how to set one up instead of failing.

**What gets sent to the service when you use these features:** your team's standings,
recent results, stat leaders, prospect and contract summaries, and finances — all
fictional game data. Nothing personal, and nothing at all if you never press those
buttons.

## Where saves are found

The app auto-detects OOTP 27 saves in these locations:

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| macOS (Mac App Store) | `~/Library/Containers/com.ootpdevelopments.ootp27macqlm/Data/Application Support/Out of the Park Developments/OOTP Baseball 27/saved_games/` |
| macOS (direct download) | `~/Library/Application Support/Out of the Park Developments/OOTP Baseball 27/saved_games/` |
| Windows | `Documents\Out of the Park Developments\OOTP Baseball 27\saved_games\` |
| OneDrive-synced | `~/OneDrive/Documents/Out of the Park Developments/OOTP Baseball 27/saved_games/` |

If your saves live somewhere else, add the path to `saveGameRoots()` in
[`server/paths.ts`](server/paths.ts).

---

## Troubleshooting

**"No OOTP 27 saves detected"**
The app looks in the paths above. Confirm your save is in one of them, or add your
location to `server/paths.ts`.

**Save shows "(no export)" and can't be selected**
You haven't run the CSV export yet, or it went to a different save. Redo step 3 with the
correct save loaded.

**`npm install` fails building `better-sqlite3`**
It needs build tools for the native module.
On macOS: `xcode-select --install`.
On Windows: install the "Desktop development with C++" workload from
[Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), then retry.

**Port 5173 or 5178 already in use**
Something else is on those ports. Set `OOTP_FO_PORT` to move the API when you run
`npm start` (for example `OOTP_FO_PORT=5200 npm start`, or in PowerShell
`$env:OOTP_FO_PORT=5200; npm start`). The UI port is in [`vite.config.ts`](vite.config.ts).
The generic `PORT` variable is ignored on purpose: tools that set it would otherwise
land the API on the UI's port.

**A page is empty or a stat looks wrong**
Most likely the export is stale or partial. Re-export from OOTP and hit **↻ Refresh**.

**Development page says it's waiting**
It needs at least two snapshots from two different in-game dates. Sim a few days, export
again, and it'll populate.

---

## Building the desktop apps

```bash
npm run dist:mac    # → release/*.dmg
npm run dist:win    # → release/*.exe
```

Releases are normally built by CI instead. Push a version tag and GitHub Actions builds
both platforms on real macOS and Windows runners:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0
```

You can also trigger the workflow manually from the Actions tab to get installers without
cutting a release.

**Apple signing (optional).** With an Apple Developer account, add these repository
secrets and macOS builds are signed and notarized automatically — without them the build
still succeeds, just unsigned:

| Secret | What it is |
|---|---|
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12` | Developer ID Application cert, exported as `.p12`, base64-encoded |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password you set on that `.p12` |
| `APPLE_ID` | Your Apple ID email |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | App-specific password from appleid.apple.com |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Team ID from your Apple Developer account |

> Use **Developer ID** distribution, not the Mac App Store. App Store apps must be
> sandboxed, and a sandboxed app can't read OOTP's save folders — automatic save
> detection would break.

### The one wrinkle: native module ABI

`better-sqlite3` is a compiled native module, and Electron bundles its own Node with a
different ABI than your system Node. The same binary can't serve both, so the desktop
scripts rebuild it for Electron automatically. **After building the desktop app, run this
before going back to browser development:**

```bash
npm run abi:node
```

If you run Node 24 locally (matching Electron's bundled Node), the ABIs line up and you
can ignore this entirely. CI never hits it, since each run starts from a clean checkout.

## How it works

- **Importer** ([`server/importer.ts`](server/importer.ts)) — reads every CSV into SQLite,
  one table per file, columns taken from each file's header row. Deliberately
  schema-tolerant so it survives OOTP updates.
- **Watcher** ([`server/watcher.ts`](server/watcher.ts)) — debounced file watcher that
  re-imports when OOTP writes a fresh export.
- **API** (`server/*.ts`) — Express + better-sqlite3. All analysis happens in SQL and
  plain TypeScript; no external services.
- **UI** (`src/`) — React + Vite.
- **Persistent store** ([`server/history.ts`](server/history.ts)) — a second SQLite
  database for rating snapshots and your watchlist, kept separate so re-imports never
  wipe it.

Two OOTP data quirks worth knowing if you're extending this: dates are unpadded
(`2026-4-9`), so they must be parsed before sorting, and `players_contract.current_year`
counts *completed* contract years, so this season's salary is `salary{current_year}`
(0-indexed).

## Configurable stat columns

On the Rosters page, **⚙ Columns** opens a picker with every available stat, grouped
into Counting, Rate, and Advanced, each with a plain-English description. Your selection
is saved per batting/pitching and persists across sessions. Hovering any column header
explains what the stat means.

### About OPS+, wRC+, and ERA+

OOTP computes these in-game but **does not include them in the CSV export**, so the app
derives them from the raw counting stats:

- **League baselines are computed from your save**, not hardcoded — per league *and* per
  level, so a Double-A hitter is measured against Double-A rather than the majors.
- **Park factors come from OOTP's own park ratings** (its AVG and HR ratings, blended),
  with the deviation halved because a player only plays half his games at home — the
  standard correction for park-adjusted rate stats.
- **wRC+** uses wOBA linear weights with the run conversion those same weights imply.
- **FIP** is scaled with a league constant so league FIP equals league ERA.

`npm run check:stats` validates the whole engine: it confirms every league's aggregate
line scores exactly 100, which is the definition these stats have to satisfy. A pitcher
with a 0.00 ERA shows **∞** for ERA+, which is what it mathematically is.

## Notes and limitations

- Ratings shown are **your scouts' evaluations**, including their bias — same as what
  you see in-game. They're exported on whatever scale your save uses (20-80 by default).
- Recommendations are decision *aids*, not gospel. Every ranked player shows the reasons
  behind their score so you can judge for yourself.
- Small samples early in a season make prospect and hot/cold signals noisy. Minimums are
  enforced (60 PA / 15 IP for prospects) but a hot April is still a hot April.
- This is an unofficial fan project, not affiliated with or endorsed by Out of the Park
  Developments.
